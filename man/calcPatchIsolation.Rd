\title{Calculate the KNN distance between patches in a binary raster (or raster(s); a vector or list) specified by r=RasterLayer.
You can either return the KNN index or some statistic (e.g., mean) specified by fun=.  The default action is to return the full index.
I have added multi-core support and use the gdal backend by default for this analysis. It's much faster than doing it in pure 'R'.}
\usage{
calcPatchIsolation(r, fun = NA, k = 1, method = "gdal",
  parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{a function that is applied to all KNN distances (i.e., for calculating mean/median/mode distances).}

\item{k}{the K (e.g., 1,2,3) value used for our K nearest-neighbor calculation.}

\item{method}{string specifying whether 'gdal' or 'R' is used to vectorize our raster patches for the KNN calculation.}

\item{parallel}{TRUE/FALSE specifying whether to parallelize our vectorization / KNN operations.}
}
